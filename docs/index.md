# Introduction

## <u>What is this?</u>

**This is the Main Code Guideline that Aethel Bon Crown uses whenever coding in C++.**

**It is designed to be used for solo C++ Projects and solo C++ Libraries,** different guidelines will be created for different scales of Team Projects and also for different languages.(At the time of writing)  

## <u>General Format</u>

At the time of writing, it is under my admission that I do not have a real understanding on how to go about organising documentation, much less something as verbose as a Code guideline.

It should be stated that major changes and overhauls are likely to be done for this project within the near future.  
This should be kept in mind not only for readers of this but also to myself, within the future, no matter how annoying it may seem.

#### <u>Due to the aforementioned reasons the current format for the guideline will be :</u>

- **A topic per page**
- **Topics are organised within Scopes**
- Each Page discussing an aspect of C++ Syntax and the rules that should be followed

### <u>What is a Topic?</u>

**A Topic within this Guideline can be defined as a C++ Statement or series of statements which have been written with a singular intention.**

These intentions generally already posses a term associated with them such as Instantiation or Assignment however others don't.   
An Example of this being : `using an if statement to end a function early.`

### <u>Why Organise topics within Scopes?</u>

**Several Topics should change rules depending on context.**  
Using an if statement within a function where you have access to the return statement should have a different ruleset than within Local Scope, or naming conventions of public and private data members should be distinguishable from variables declared within the scope of a function.

I believe that a good code guideline should be formatted in a way that at the very least naming convention wise, you should be able to look at a snippet of code and tell where it is located.

With this in mind we can segment groups of rules into the environment you find them in or in C++ what we can call **Scopes** (the actual C++ language feature).

## <u>Interlude</u>

With all this in mind, I hope whoever finds this is able to read this to completion.  

**As of writing the Guideline is incomplete.**  
Even when it reaches a level where it's more to put together, I will most likely keep adding small experts here and there.

Happy Reading !
