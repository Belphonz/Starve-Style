# Introduction

## <u>What is this ?</u>

This is the Main Code Guideline that Aethel Bon Crown uses whenever coding in C++.
It is designed to be used for solo C++ Projects and solo C++ Libraries, different guideline will be created for different scales of Team Projects and also for different languages at a later date at the Time of writing.  

## <u>General Format</u>

At the current time of writing, it is under my admission that I do not have a real understanding on how to go about organising documentation much less something as verbose as a Code guideline, so it should be stated that major changes and overhauls are likely to be done for this project within the near future and should be kept in mind not only for readers of this but also to me within the future no matter how annoying it may seem.
