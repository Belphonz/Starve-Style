# Global Variables

Global Constant variables should be written in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.
They should always be within a namespace.  
They should clearly describe what they are, so they should be as long as they need to be.  
Example : 

``` cpp linenums="1"
namespace MAT
{
	constexpr float PI{ 3.14159 };
}
```
